# VanHackaton - PDF Form Filler
This is an REST API that dinamically fill PDF forms with database data.
## The Challenge
### Why
We are trying to automate some of our daily tasks. One of them is filling out immigration PDF forms. We need to be able to fill out a specific PDF form using data from our database.
### What
We would like to be able to fill out a PDF form automatically and generate a new version with all its fields filled out.
### Recommendations
+ You can use any programming language to accomplish this task;
+ Youâ€™re free to use any 3rd party API/library, but you must include all detailed info about it;
+ You must include detailed information about how to run your project.
### Output
+ The same PDF with some data filled in
### PDF File
https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/apps/EForms/pdf/en/ESDC-EMP5624.pdf
## Introduction
With this project I wanted to do a little more than the challenge required, so instead of hardcoding everything to the specified form, I chose to do it more dynamically. Therefore, with this API you can upload any PDF file and it will be stored on the API server. In addition, you can map all fields in the uploaded file to fixed values, database values, or some calculation.

This project was implemented assuming the data is stored in a NoSQL database (such as MongoDB), so the sample database files are in JSON format.
## Features
+ Language: C# with .NET Core 2.1
+ 3rd party tools:
  + [iText 7 Community](https://itextpdf.com/en)
### iText 7
This is a powerful PDF Toolkit for PDF generation, PDF programming, handling & manipulation. It was used in this project to scan and fill the forms of the PDF file. This API has an open source [AGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). For more information access their [website](https://itextpdf.com/en).
## Run locally
To run the project you must have installed [.NET Core SDK 2.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1)
### From command line
``` bash
$ cd [SOLUTION_PATH]/PdfFormFiller.Api
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet clean
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```
### From Visual Studio
To run from Visual Studio, you must have installed [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later.
+ Open the solution on Visual Studio and press F5.
